# CS5132 Programming Assignment 2
done by Chng Yaw Tia, Liew Wei Pyn and Oh Zhi Yuan

### Description

In this project, we have identified B-trees as a way to enable teachers to filter through their emails quickly to find emails that have been buried but need to be looked at again. 
Hence, we have implemented the B-tree and created a GUI which allows the user to visualize what goes on inside a B-tree, together with a sample dataset.

### What should I do from here?
BNode.java (extended from Node.java) and BTree.java contain the code for the B-tree. Testcases to verify its robustness are found in BTreeTester.java

To see a sample of how we could tackle the societal issue, go to EmailTester.java

To view the application we have created, download out/artifacts/CS5132PA2_Group_jar/CS5132PA2_Group.jar and execute the file.
